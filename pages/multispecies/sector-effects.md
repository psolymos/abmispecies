title: Sector effects
description: "Sector effects."
---

We use the species-habitat models to estimate the effects of individual industrial sectors on each species in a given region. We differentiate the following sectors: Agriculture, Forestry, Energy, Rural/Urban, and Transportation. We summarize current and relative abundance for each industrial sector in that region, besides relative abundance in native (undisturbed) land cover types (where current and reference abundances are equal).

Sector effects on regional population for a given sector are calculated as the difference between sector specific current and reference abundance, standardized by the total reference abundance in the entire region (including all sectors and native land cover types).

The "vase" diagrams highlight the distribution of sector effects within the set of species, here the 6 main taxonomic groups sampled by the ABMI.
