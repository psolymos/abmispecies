title: Human footprint change
description: "Human footprint change."
---

The conversion of natural habitats to habitats marked by
human footprint is the greatest threat to biodiversity.
In central and southern Alberta, most land conversion
is associated with agriculture and urban growth, while
in northern Alberta, forest harvesting has been the
dominant land conversion activity. Over the past few
decades, the development of oil and gas and transportation
infrastructure has also expanded significantly, resulting
in the modification of natural habitats throughout the
province.

The Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute determined the amount
and change in human footprint for each of Alberta's
natural regions over time. In addition, we evaluated the
degree to which different types of native habitat have been
converted by each footprint type. This information can
be used by planners, managers, and the general public to
understand how native habitats and biodiversity in Alberta
are changing.
