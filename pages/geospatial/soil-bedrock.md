This GIS layer is a generalized compilation of existing geological maps and 
original geological mapping by Alberta Geological Survey staff. Mapping included 
field observations and creating three-dimensional models of subsurface 
stratigraphy based on the interpretation of geophysical logs from oil and gas 
wells. Each three-dimensional formation surface was projected to a model of 
the bedrock surface and the intersection formed the first approximation of the 
position of the geological contact at the base of the surficial deposits. 
These preliminary contacts were then adjusted to honour outcrop data and the 
interpretation of the bedrock unit immediately below surficial deposits in 
individual wells. This GIS layer was created at a scale of 1:1,000,000 and 
can be accessed [here](http://www.ags.gov.ab.ca/publications/abstracts/MAP_600.html).
