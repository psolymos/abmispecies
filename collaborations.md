description: "Collaborations, ABMI Species Website."
---

This website has been created by the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) Science Team; the team integrated the information, ran the analyses, created the website content and built the website architecture. Throughout this process, ABMI collaborated with a variety of institutions, organizations and individuals to develop predictive species/habitat modeling in Alberta. These collaborations were essential at all steps of the process of generating the content for this website.

## Conceptualization

We thank many present and past members of the ABMI who helped in building the conceptual foundations of the cumulative effects monitoring framework (Burton et al. 2014) and the dose-response type intactness modeling (Nielsen et al. 2007, Lamb et al. 2009).

## Remotely sensed and geospatial information 

* Human Footprint Base Layer Database: ESRD
* Cutblock layer: ESRD and Foothills Research Institute (FRI)
* GoA SPOT imagery (1999-2013): ESRD
* VALTUS imagery: ESRD 
* IRS imagery: ESRD
* Alberta Merged Wetland Inventory: ESRD
* Primary Land and Vegetation Inventory (PLVI): ESRD
* Grassland Vegetation Inventory (GVI): ESRD
* Alberta Vegetation  Inventory (AVI): ESRD
* Diana Stralberg (University of Alberta) interpolated climate data  to be used in modeling
* Scott Nielsen (University of Alberta) provided GIS layers on topography and enduring  features in Alberta

## Bird Point Counts 
Information from ABMI bird point counts was combined with information from other organizations and individuals:

* Environment Canada ([North American Breeding Bird Survey](https://ec.gc.ca/reom-mbs/) and [Joint Oil Sands Monitoring programs](http://www.jointoilsandsmonitoring.ca))
* Ecological Monitoring Committee for the Lower Athabasca ([EMCLA](http://www.emcla.ca/))
* Dr. Erin Bayne (University of Alberta)

## Mammal Winter Track Counts 

Information from ABMI winter track counts were combined with information from other individuals:

* Dr. Erin Bayne (University of Alberta)
* Dr. Stan Boutin (University of Alberta)

## Vascular Plant Plots

Information from ABMI vascular plant plots were used.

## Bryophytes Plots

Information from ABMI bryophyte plots were used.

## Lichen Plots

Information from ABMI lichen plots were used.

## Mite Soil Cores

Information from ABMI mite soil cores were used.
